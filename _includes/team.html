        Caroline is all about the ladies. Specifically, ladies in
        entrepreneurship. At just six years old, she began innovating,
        problem-solving, and noticing when niche markets should be explored
        (her lemonade stand outside the entrance to the Ryder Cup made
        tens of dollars). Since then, she's branched out of the service
        industry, and most recently researched for both the Sloan
        School and The Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship
        at Harvard Business School. Interests include gender
        equality, chocolate, and skiing.

		Ever since he swallowed the red pill last spring,

		himself <a href='http://wp.me/p24oeJ-d'>Objective-C</a> and developed an
		<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yale-daily-news/id480072824?mt=8">iPhone app</a>

		He is excited to work on similar projects this coming semester as he
		discovers just how far the rabbit hole goes.
		Oh yea, and lest he forget -- he loves to run, pun, and cook.
