    <div class="name">HackYale is Recruiting Teachers!</div>
    <div class="description">
      We're a small group of students that teach the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, but more importantly, try to convey why we love programming, building apps and hacker culture. So as the year kicks off, we're calling all forces: if you love programming and love to get others to love programming, we want you as a HackYale instructor. You're empathetic, devoted and technically skilledâ€”we recommend at least one year of experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as fluency with at least one other programming language. 
      If this sounds like something you'd grab by the horns, please apply by September 4!
