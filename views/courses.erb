        <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/kylelawrencejensen/" target="_blank">Kyle</a> holds a Ph.D. from MIT in chemical engineering and is a founder of <a href="http://pitrho.com" target="_blank">Pit Rho</a>, 
        which provides real-time analytics for motorsports teams. He'll be talking on Thursday about Data Science, a hot topic in today's data-driven world. It will be a tour of data science methods with Python, touching on data mundging, machine learning, regression, bayesian methods, natural language processing, big data. Highly recommended, especially for CS students.

        Recommended: Basic programming experience and perhaps some Python, but that's not as necessary.

        If you're dying to learn how to make a website but don't know where to start, this is the class for you. We've designed a curriculum where you'll work closely with other students to learn what the Internet is, how it works and how you can get your ideas out there. We take a project-based approach, so our goal is that by the end of the class, you'll have made some like-minded friends and built a live website. No programming experience required!
      </p>
      <p>
        At least 6 weekly meetings, Friday 1 - 2:30 p.m. or Thursday 8 - 9:30 p.m. starting 9/19/2013.

      <p>
        This class is where programmers become true hackers (not in the evil way, but the 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture)" target="_blank">good way</a>). 
        We'll show you the ropes of HTML, CSS and Javascript, then dive right into using various frameworks and web-specific programming techniques, developing open source and learning to deploy quickly. We want you to have taken CS 112 or equivalent and have a do-it-yourself attitude. This is the flagship HackYale class, supercharged!

    <div class="description">
      We're a small group of students that teach the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, but more importantly, try to convey why we love programming, building apps and hacker culture. So as the year kicks off, we're calling all forces: if you love programming and love to get others to love programming, we want you as a HackYale instructor. You're empathetic, devoted and technically skilledâ€”we recommend at least one year of experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as fluency with at least one other programming language. 
      If this sounds like something you'd grab by the horns, please apply by September 4!
