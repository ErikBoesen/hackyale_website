    <div class="about">
        Rafi hopped on the code game back in junior year of high school,
        going on to work on the <a href="http://google.org/crisismap" target="_blank">Crisis Map</a> at Google this summer and serve as Tech Director of <a href="http://gakkoproject.com" target="_blank">GAKKO</a>. Now he dwells at a curious intersection of app development,
        design frenzy and algorithmic implementationâ€”you can check out his projects <a href="http://rafi.me/portfolio" target="_blank">here</a>.
        A connoisseur of fine wit, Rafi spends him time dancing with
        <a href='http://yale.edu/bhangra' target='_blank'>Yale Jashan Bhangra</a>,
        crafting puns and just walking around, checkin' stuff out.

    <div class="about">
        Caroline is all about the ladies. Specifically, ladies in entrepreneurship. At just six years old, she began innovating, problem-solving, and noticing when niche markets should be explored (her lemonade stand outside the entrance to the Ryder Cup made tens of dollars). Since then, she's branched out of the service industry and into both research - for the Sloan School and The Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School - and starting her own non-profit project. Interests include Law and Order SVU, the sustainable food movement, and skiing.

	<div class="about">
		Ever since he swallowed the red pill last spring,
		Daniel has dedicated his time to developing awesome
		software and learning just how far we can go with
		modern technology.  Although his primary expertise
		is in C (with Python next on the docket), he recently taught
		himself <a href='http://wp.me/p24oeJ-d'>Objective-C</a> and developed an
		<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yale-daily-news/id480072824?mt=8">iPhone app</a>
		for the Yale Daily News.
		He is excited to work on similar projects this coming semester as he
		discovers just how far the rabbit hole goes.
		Oh yea, and lest he forget -- he loves to run, pun, and cook.
