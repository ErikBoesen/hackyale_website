                You love to learn, and equally love to share your knowledge with others. You’re both a listener and contributor. Ideally, you’re active in the open-source community.
                Your JavaScript code is both art and beauty, architected scalability and re-use.  Your operators are always === and you are a master of closures. Your code feels at home on Node.js and you have strong opinions on code structure and modularization.
                You bend HTML and CSS to your will. Your HTML is semantic, and you are a master of your CSS pre-processor. You like variables in your CSS and your HTML is modular and templated.
                You rock AJAX, get annoyed with page refreshes, and like to give your web apps a little Backbone.
                Code without tests makes you sick. Unit-testing and TDD are your best friends. When you collaborate, you <code>git rebase -i</code>. You reach deep down the stack and have an opinon on API's and server architecture.
                You take great pleasure in working out the details behind, and even more in execution.  You are a great communicator and you take care to understand before making yourself understood.
